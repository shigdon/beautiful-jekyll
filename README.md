# My Blog Website

This is my personal blog hosted through [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages) and created using both markdown and the [Beautiful-Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) theme created by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com)*.

The embedded CV and other features were inspired by [@taylorreiter](https://github.com/taylorreiter/taylorreiter.github.io) and [@ryanpeek](https://github.com/ryanpeek/ryanpeek.github.io).
