I consider myself to be a __Computational Biologist__ with an ongoing love affair with __Biotechnology__.

In June, 2020 I received my __*PhD*__ in Plant Biology after doing some pretty exciting research with microbes isolated from an exotic variety of corn!

Overall, my work interests lie with collaborative projects that integrate __Bioinformatics__, __DNA Sequencing__, and __Microbial Ecology__ to drive innovation in __Human Health__ & __Sustainable Agriculture__.

I've lived the majority of my life in the *Southwestern United States of America*, namely Arizona, New Mexico and California.

I enjoy working on Microbiome research projects and have an open mind when it comes to exploring the microbiota of different biological systems.

Collaborating with researcher's around the world is important to me and I'm currently working with groups in Bolivia, Thailand and the United States.
